I used a few additional resources quite extensively. They include:
  StackOverflow
  W3Schools
  JSONLint
  TwitterBootstrap

I also have been simultaneously working through a HTML/CSS/Javascript basics cours on Udemy
  "The Complete Web Developer Course - Build 14 Websites" at https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/#/
